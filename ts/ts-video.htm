Yep, it has come to this. Just like for timing, I made some videos for typesetting too.<br><br><br>

<h3>Part 1 - about 10 signs in Namiuchigiwa no Muromi-san.</h3>

<br><br>

Some signs from one episode of Muromi. Everything from timing to final product, with typeset commentary.<br>
No mocha tracking, nothing too difficult. Styles are already created because looking for fonts would make the video 10 times longer and more boring.

<h3>Part 2 - 50 signs in Monogatari 2nd Season.</h3>

This will probably not teach you anything; it's more of a reference point to see what can be done and maybe fun to watch. I took first 50 signs (there are usually 100-200 per episode) and timed & typeset those in 20 minutes.<br>
I use scripts that I specifically wrote for Monogatari and the efficiency is almost ridiculous.

<h3>Part 3 - 3 signs in Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai: Megami Hen.</h3>

This one is pretty simple and slow, showing some rather basic stuff.

I recorded Monogatari the next week as well, just for the heck of it. It covers pretty much the whole episode except mocha tracking/clipping for the last sign in the video and 2 more signs (Years Earlier / Present). This video is played at 2x speed, so what you see took about 28 minutes. The remaining two signs probably took at least as much and ended up looking pretty good with the effect I used. Also, this one has no commentary and is not very educational at all.
