There are several things that determine how good a typeset is and how well it blends in.<br>
Obviously, the colors and sizes of font, border, shadow. Then of course the choice of font.<br>
The next thing would be the positioning of the sign.<br>
<br>
Beginners will have this idea that the typeset for a sign should be as close as possible to the original sign.<br>
Please get this idea out of your head, because half of the time that won't work very well.<br>
It is especially unnecessary for typesetting titles.<br>
If it's a sign that belongs to a specific place on the screen, then sure, you wanna get your TS close to that.<br>
But an episode title has little relation to what's on screen in terms of placement,<br>
so no need to go crazy trying to match the position and orientation of the sign while sacrificing readability.<br><br>

I used an episode of Nichijou for a test, here are the results from some guys.


<br><br>

Kanji is often written top-to-bottom, rather than left-to-right.<br>
It works great with kanji. It does not with English.<br>
So don't try rotating the text like this just to match the orientation of the japanese sign.<br>
It decreases readability and doesn't really look that great.<br>
You might think of using M\No\Nt\Ni\Nv\Na\Nt\Ni\No\Nn. In other words top-to-bottom, without the rotation. Well... try it.<br>
For one, you will usually have large spaces between the letters. But even if you pick a font that doesn't do that, <br>
or do each letter separately, you'll run into another problem. Kanji has pretty consistent width. English letters don't.<br>
The difference in width between M and i can be anywhere from 500-1000%, depending on the font. So this will usually not work either.<br>

<br>
Also here ^ the white 'shadow' is missing.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="mot2.jpg"><br><br>
This is a pretty good placement. It's much better to sacrifice font size and orientation if the result is well readable and looks good.<br>
The shadow is a bit too thin and jagged but this is overall fine, except that the font should be a serif one.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="mot3.jpg"><br><br>
You can do something like this. Pick a font that will look good, you can make it large enough so that it's both readable and close to the <br>
size of the kanji, and keep at least some kind of alignment when posotioning it, in this case the top aligned with top of the the kanji.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="mot6.jpg"><br><br>
You can even put it on the other side of the screen for overall symmetry.<br>
If you want it top-to-bottom, it may be better this way than rotating, but I'd say it's almost always better to keep it left-to-right.<br>
Trying to split the text like this will rarely work well for a number of reasons, like the width inconsistency that you see here.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="req1.jpg"><br><br>
Another title. Here I think if the font was larger, to match the span on the kanji precisely, thicker, and placed a bit farther,<br>
it might actually not <i>look</i> too bad (putting aside the readability issue)...<br>

<br><br>
<img src="req2.jpg"><br><br>
...but clearly this works much better. It's aligned to the centre of the kanji, looks fine except for the font.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="req3.jpg"><br><br>
Here aligned to top, with a different font.<br><br>

There's never one "correct" place for typesets.<br>
Rather than following some rigid logic for where a sign should be, just make it "look good."<br>
It doesn't even necessarily have to be aligned with the original sign in any way.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="nichi6.jpg"><br><br>
Here it pretty much ignores the jp sign.<br>
Instead it's in the middle of the "background" area - the sky - where it doesn't interfere with the foreground.<br>
It's kind of where you'd put it in the first place, if the jp one wasn't there at all...<br>
pretty much the most natural place for a title on this screen, assuming the title is horizontal.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="nichi7.jpg"><br><br>
If the jp is in the middle, and you can't exactly fit the typeset in the middle as well, you may split it like this (if the words allow it).<br>

<br><br>
<img src="nichi11.jpg"><br><br>
This should be pretty obvious. You don't want the sign over Yukko's head, and you don't want it over the papers above either.<br>
The neutral green area is the most suitable place. If you split the title in 2 lines, you could put it in the large green area on the left.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="principal.jpg"><br><br>
Here you have 2 typesets and main dialogue, so first of all you want to avoid any of them overlapping.<br>
The title is where it is pretty much out of necessity. There's hardly any other place suitable for it.<br>
The office sign... many would try to fit it <b>on</b> the white board, along with the japanese.<br>
That can certainly be done, but you'll have to have <b>really</b> small font size and it'll still look cramped.<br>
So I put it above, and matched the width of the sign and thickness of the letters roughly.<br>
It looked too artificial without that shadow, so that was added to give it some sense of space, even though as a "shadow" it's illogical.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="shino.jpg"><br><br>
Here again trying to squeeze the Shino Labs <b>on</b> the signboard would be frustratingly difficult & just wouldn't look good no matter what.<br><br>
On an unrelated note, did you know sharks can fly?<br><br>
Anyway...<br><br>

One other option is to simply replace the jp sign with the English one.<br>
That will, however, only work well if the background is one solid color.<br>
Here's one where it will be simple enough:

<br><br>
<img src="drawsign1.jpg"><br><br>

You'll be creating 2 layers. One will just draw a blue rectangle over the kanji.<br>
The other will put the English text over it.<br>
Normally I make the actual sign first. Then I duplicate it and delete content.<br>
Then paste this instead: {\p1}m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100{\p0} <br>
That's a basic square in drawing mode. Nuke border/shadow if present.<br>
Expand it using the scaling tool (\fscx\fscy) to the size needed to cover the kanji.<br>
Add \blur1 to make the edges softer to prevent them from being noticeable.<br>
Match the blue color and adjust layers so that text is on top of the rectangle.<br>
The result will look like this:

<br><br>
<img src="drawsign2.jpg"><br><br>

And just in case this was difficult to comprehend, here it's disassembled:
<br><br>
<img src="drawsign3.jpg"><br><br>

You could create more complex shapes than a rectangle.<br>
