Here I'll be posting some examples of typesets that I've found in various releases.<br>
Some of them not too bad but could easily be better, some of them pretty bad for no good reason.<br><br>

I'll be updating this page as I find new interesting things.<br><br>



<br><br>
<img src="machine1.jpg"><br><br>
This is dickpants typesetting 101.<br>
JP sign: large thick "serif" (not sure how to define that in kanji but should be close enough) font, no border, has shadow.<br>
"Typeset:" small thin sans serif font, no shadow, fucking black border...<br>
Question: Why?<br><br>
I can't believe this was actually released. No matter how little you know about typesetting, <br>
you should be albe to handle borders and shadows. Font size is pretty easy as well.<br><br>

Takes 1 minute to fix, out of which 40 seconds will be looking for a good font...

<br><br>
<img src="machine2.jpg"><br><br>
How hard can this be? ^<br><br>
Same here...


<br><br>
<img src="manner1.jpg"><br><br>
Might be good to use a font with dots, nuke that retarded border, add a little blur...

<br><br>
<img src="manner2.jpg"><br><br>
There you go. Viewers might as well think the studio used both japanese and english title.<br>
Even if you don't have a font with dots, it would still be common sense to at least type \bord0.

<br><br>
<img src="miraibook1.jpg"><br><br>
I don't even...<br><br>
90 degrees rotation successful, yes, but that's about it. Well, I'll give credit for the font on the left, that works (but not like this).<br>
Other than that it's "Herp derp. Let's put some text over here... bam! Finished."<br><br>

Left sign: Text is black, so keep it that way, and place it somewhere where it doesn't overlap with other things.<br><br>
Right sign: If you have to choose between placing the TS a bit further from the sign with smaller font, and full retard mode, please don't choose full retard mode.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="miraibook2.jpg"><br><br>
This is still all very easy. <br>
Nuke (something that looks totally like) Arial, nuke border where it shouldn't be, don't use colors that aren't even on the screen, add a bit of blur.<br>
Oh and don't place typesets "over" the signs, duh. This "let's put it as close to the original sign as possible" strategy is pretty dumb.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="muru1.jpg"><br><br>
Muru Muru tries harder and so does the typesetter. Too bad he still fails.<br>
The colors kind of match, mostly, so that's an improvement. Font is not Arial so that's another. Aside from the one in the red box though, the font still sucks.<br>
Using a very round font for squarish signs is not the brightest choice. The next obvious thing is the border. The jp signs have a very thick one so why use thin?<br>
Probably the most awesome thing though... watch how the "Future Diary" casts a sharp bright shadow over dark things. Amazing, huh?<br>
So, dear typesetting students, if you want a shadow that isn't too dark, you don't do it by choosing grey color. <br>
You do it by increasing transparency. (\4a&H<font color=778899><b>90</b></font> or whatever value works) And use the damn \blur tag.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="muru2.jpg"><br><br>
So, pick better fonts, fix the borders and shadows and it looks a lot less fake.<br>
This is still far from great, but it's far better than the one above and took only a few minutes to change.<br>
The bottom sign could be much better, but since there are already 3 signs on the screen, I didn't want to add too many layers with blur, since it might lag.<br><br>
<br><br>



<br><br>
<img src="pirat01.jpg"><br><br>
Not bad, generally fits in but...<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="pirat02.jpg"><br><br>
...font and one extra layer and you're much closer.<br>
The middle layer has dark inner color and thin bright border and is positioned a bit up and left.<br>
Bottom layer is just one color and \blur5.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="lamp-whynot.jpg"><br><br>
Here you obviously have a problem with alignment and color doesn't match.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="lamp-com.jpg"><br><br>
This one's much better on both counts, but still has issues.<br>
The alignment is still a bit off, but few people would notice.<br>
Main problem is readability, because of the color, especially for 'Lamp'.<br>
Let's explain one thing here... I'm sure the color was matched with eyedropper,<br>
but that doesn't always work. The reason is difference in background brightness.<br>
The typeset is on darker background than most of the jp sign.<br>
The darker the background, the darker the font has to be.<br>
You can check with eyedropper that the jp signs follow that pattern.<br>
Otherwise visibility goes down when the brightness is similar for both,<br>
even if it's a different color.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="lamp-ua.jpg"><br><br>
So if I fix the alignment and adjust the colors, it gets another notch better.<br>
As it often is in such cases, the color changes a few times throughout the line,<br>
because so does the background.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="doki-rest.jpg"><br><br>
Here, have some Doki quality.<br>
Apart from the crappy translation [no, I can't read moonrunes, but I'm told by translators this is like google translate],<br>
this is typical Doki typesetting. They kinda know how to do it, but not really. They can use rotations, but do it wrong.<br>
See chapter on aligning to learn how to do it right.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="hadena-rest.jpg"><br><br>
Doki can always be beaten by experts from Hadena. This group is a true legend.<br>
No one else can fuck up translating, editing, timing, typesetting and encoding [let's not even mention QC here] with such magnificence.<br>
All of it apparently despite people from other groups trying to help them.<br>
So what in the bloody hell is this?<br>
- They decided to use a mask.<br>
- Failed to match the outline of the sign.<br>
- Failed to cover the bottom of the sign.<br>
- Failed to use blur on it, making it jagged as a chainsaw.<br>
- Used a bit of transparency, so that you can see the kanji underneath, for whatever unknown reason.<br>
- Used a FUCKING SHADOW on the mask!<br>
- Put text on it.<br>
- Each word going in different direction.<br>
<br>
I. Don't. Even.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="hadena-lolsign2.jpg"><br><br>
Hello. This is Hadena again. We can put text on screen, see?<br>
What? What is blur? We don't heared about this. But sharper is better quality!<br>
What, shadow? We can has no shadow? Oh. But. It look more proffessionull with shadow, no?<br><br>
OK, anyway...<br>


<br><br>
<img src="cms-music.jpg"><br><br>
Here's some other derps. Clearly they don't have what it takes to be a legend like Hadena.<br>
So they might as well try a bit harder and produce something decent maybe.<br>
They could start by matching the color right.<br>
I know most people wouldn't bother with 2 layers but... it looks so much better if you can blur the red as well.<br>
Oh well...<br>


<br><br>
<img src="cms-wtf.jpg"><br><br>
Scary indeed! Beware of brazillian typesetters! [I dunno, just guessing...]<br>
Same guys as previous sign. Maybe they should go for a legend after all. This is pretty... scary.<br>
Seeing that, somehow I'm not worried about molesters at all. There's something more sinister lurking around.<br>
Also the main font with purple shadow...<br>



<br><br>
<img src="hadena-lolsign1.jpg"><br><br>
But guess what? Beware some more, because Hadena is back, motherfuckers!<br>
Typesets attacking you from unexpected angles, right about to drop a few child molesters on your head as they fly over you.<br><br>

Honestly, the best group for this sign was HorribleSubs with \a6.<br>
I thought the idea of fansubs was to <i>improve</i> the quality of crunchyroll, not make it worse. But what do I know.<br><br>




<br><br><br>

Here's a bunch of groups doing the same sign:

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-afftw-hatsuyuki.jpg"><br><br>
This looks ok, though the color is a bit off.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-asenshi.jpg"><br><br>
This color is also off and it's missing blur on top of that.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-commie.jpg"><br><br>
Color is off. I think this was herkz, who likes to laugh at others for exactly this so feel free to laugh at him.<br>
Also it's only like 1 pixel away from the jp, which is pretty dumb, since there's plenty of space below.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-nishishi.jpg"><br><br>
Finally somebody got closer to the color, best so far.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-whynot.jpg"><br><br>
Here the color is off again. I don't know what everyone's problem here is. Also seems to lack blur.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-asukasubs.jpg"><br><br>
Yeah, I know what your question is. The answer is: asuka subs.<br>
What can I say?<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign1-CCS.jpg"><br><br>
Nope.<br>
It's true that replacing the jp seems like a good idea here since nothing's in the way.<br>
But first, this is not the kind of font you'd have on a cell phone.<br>
And more importantly, if you can't match the color of the background, just find another job.<br>


<br><br><img src="BRS-sign2-commie.jpg"><br><br>
Yep.<br>


<br><br><img src="BRS-sign2-asenshi.jpg"><br><br>
Good enough, but could be better.<br>
The end should be leaning a lot more to the right, you can clearly see the edges of the mask, etc.<br>
You know, if you just put \blur2 on the mask, it'll do the trick in many, if not most, cases.<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign2-asukasubs.jpg"><br><br>
Uh-huh. Ok. You were saying you can typeset? I see. Where did you get that idea?<br>

<br><br><img src="BRS-sign2-CCS.jpg"><br><br>
I don't even...



<br><br><br><br><br><br>




Here's something fun I did recently:

<br><br><img src="nyarlatube.png"><br><br>

What do you need to do this?<br>
First, a fitting font. Check.<br>
Now, there's not enough space on the sign to put the English next to the jp, so... masking.<br>
Make a regular square mask, scale it to the size of the sign.<br>
Use rotation and \fax or \fay to make it fit.<br>
Use the clipping tool to cut the mask so that the yellow thing is not masked.<br>
The main problem is, you can't mask the letters without masking the circles too.<br>
You could just ignore the circles and pretend like they weren't there but... we're no amateurs here, right?<br>
So we make circles. Make letter o or O, scale it up, blur, set alpha to ~H80 [so that you can make the circles overlap], set color.<br>
Use clip to limit the blue circle to the sign only.<br>
Now the letters... color, blur, rotations and \fax to align the sign properly.<br>
Set the layers correctly... mask is 0, circles are 1 and 2, letters are 3.<br>
Done.
<br><br><br><br>


<br><br><img src="toomanyfonts.jpg"><br><br>
Let's take this opportunity to mention something else here. This is not really a case of bad typesetting per se.<br>
What happened here is these guys muxed in more than 36 MB of fonts. That's not only pretty retarded but also doesn't exactly work, as you can see.<br>
It's a limit in haali splitter or something. If you go over 36 MB with attachments, it only takes whatever 36 MB it grabs first and the rest is ignored.<br>
So if you stuff your release with a few 10 MB large fonts, you may end up with a bunch of fonts missing for playback and some terrible typesetting.<br>
I was using 31 fonts for Acchi Kocchi, and they were 1.3 MB all together, so I don't really get what's with this bloatcrap in many groups' releases.<br>
Also realize that somebody probably spent like half an hour typesetting this, and this is what the viewers saw in the end.<br>
While we're at this, also don't use mkvmerge over 5.1.1 [I think] because that causes some more problems with otf fonts.<br>
In fact, stick to mkvkerge 4.1.1 [or if higher, check the "disable header removal compression bla bla" option].


<br><br><br><br><br><br>

So that was plenty of examples of the wrong stuff. Now I should probably add some more of the good ones.<br>
I just typeset this Acchi Kocchi extra episode so here goes...<br><br>
[In the light of the previous screenshot: I used 30 fonts for this episode, total size: 1.8 MB.<br>
Hell, even all the fonts I used for all the 7 Maria episodes I typeset were 3 MB in total (about 55 fonts).]<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_04.jpg"> <img src="ak13_05.jpg"><br><br>
This would be the very basics:<br>
1. appropriate font<br>
2. correct colors<br>
3. reasonable font size + border size<br>
4. right amount of blur in 2 layers<br><br>

It shouldn't be apparent that it's not a part of the video. This is really easy, so please don't fuck up signs like these.<br>



<br><br><img src="ak13_02.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_03.jpg"> <img src="ak13_10.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_06.jpg"> <img src="ak13_08.jpg"><br><br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_07.jpg"><br><br>

I would add the spikes if it wasn't moving but... it is, so meh.<br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_09.jpg"><br><br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_11.jpg"> <img src="ak13_12.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_17.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_13.jpg"> <img src="ak13_15.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_16.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_20.jpg"><br><br>

Some clipping here. If you're gonna clip your sign, you'd better do it right, and not like some hadena or doki derps.
<br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_21.jpg"><br><br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_14.jpg"><br><br>

Shadows shouldn't be difficult either. Use \xshad & \yshad if the shadow needs a different direction.<br>
This one has only \yshad, for example.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_01.jpg"><br><br>

Two borders are also easy. You just need 3 layers instead of 2.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_18.jpg"><br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_19.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_22.jpg"><br><br>

Choosing the right font can help a lot.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_23.jpg"><br><br>

Using blur isn't really that difficult either. I don't know why more than half of the groups out there keep failing at this.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_25.jpg"><br><br>

I really wanted to imitate the dotted outline here without too much effort [like ASSDrawing all of it].<br>
So I used a font I had 2 versions of - a clean one and an eroded one [you can also see that one below].<br>
I made the top layer with the clean one and the bottom layer with the eroded one.<br>
I didn't actually use border so i just playerd with the font size, scaling and spacing till it looked like this.<br>
It's not perfect but at least it's going in the right direction. Considering that it wasn't much effort I'd say it's decent.<br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_24.jpg"><br><br>

This is kinda hard to reproduce because it has a lot of colors and a lot of blur and some transparency...<br>
but it didn't end up looking too bad, all things considered.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_26.jpg"><br><br>

Sometimes masking is obviously the better option, because you don't wanna use \fs15 and make it look bad and unreadable at the same time.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_27.jpg"><br><br>

Here masking didn't work because there are like 100 shades of blue [and it moves], but the 'Skate Rental' looks pretty good like this.<br>
The 'Ice Arena' not so much, but I didn't wanna make 8 lines that are moving so this was about the best I could do in one line.<br>
Not sure how much lag would doing each letter separately cause, but I didn't feel like trying.<br>
It would also be possible to use \org to align the letters better and mocha it but... sounds like a lot of pain, doesn't it.<br>
Besides, with the perspective here I'm not even sure what the letters should really look like [though doing each one separately would certainly improve it].<br>
I think the main thing is to not make it stand out so that by just glancing at the picture you don't notice there's something too obviously weird.<br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_28a.jpg"> <img src="ak13_28b.jpg"><br>

<br><br><img src="ak13_28c.jpg"> <img src="ak13_28d.jpg"><br><br>

I haven't really seen much of this outside of Acchi Kocchi, but this is the case where the sign zooms out with the first few frames zooming really quickly.<br>
Usually about 4-5 frames go from almost full screen to almost the final size, and then it goes slowly from there.<br>
Trying to mocha the first 4 frames can be near impossible and certainly frustrating, so I usually mocha from wherever it seems reasonable.<br>
After applying the mocha data I do the first 4 frames by hand - or if I feel like mocha could handle it, I track it all and fix the first few by hand.<br>
Mocha may handle the size and position fine, but at least the blur needs to be adjusted manually on the first frames.<br>
Then, after all the work you've done... nobody will notice those few frames. Welcome to the world of typesetting.<br>
Then again if they notice nothing, it's a lot better than if they notice how much you suck.<br>


<br><br><img src="ak13_29.jpg"><br><br>

This is like 22 lines in the script [6 of them for the topmost typeset + layers for most others]. Thankfully this was at least static.<br>
But since it is static, you can play with the details without worrying about lag.<br>
It's a lot of stuff in one frame but this is actually low-stress typesetting when you know you don't have to make everything move.<br>
You can pretty easily make this look good just with the basics - fonts, sizes, colors... some rotations and that fucking <u><b><i>blur!</u></b></i><br>
Your main goal here is to make it all blend in. Like if you show it randomly to somebody who doesn't know what's going on,<br>
they shouldn't immediately go "LOL, who put these horrible captions over this?"<br><br>


<br><br><img src="popsicle01.jpg"><img src="popsicle02.jpg"><br><br>

Layers, borders, blur, frz, fax, semitransparency on some layers... and a pretty good fade to white.




<br><br><br><br>

More to come...<br>
