Seeing from the results produced by typesetting apprentices, choosing fonts seems to be where they tend to fail.<br>
The main problem being that they don't really <b>have</b> any fonts aside from whatever is installed by default.<br>
So first you need to get at least some small collection of useful fonts.<br><br>

You can get those from various places. Obviously there are websites with fonts.<br>
Here are some you can try out: 
<a href="http://ufonts.com/">ufonts</a> |
<a href="http://www.fontspace.com">fontspace</a> |
<a href="http://www.azfonts.net">azfonts</a> |
<a href="http://www.fontsner.com/">fontsner</a> |
<a href="http://www.dafont.com">dafont</a> |
<a href="http://www.ffonts.net/">ffonts</a> <br>
You can also extract fonts from decently typeset fansub releases, which is not necessarily as dumb as it sounds,<br>
since you'll easily get to a lot of fonts that are actually suitable for anime typesetting.<br>
Or you can do what I do - download large font packs from torrents, go though thousands of fonts, delete all the useless ones <br>
(yeah, about 80%) and sort the useful ones so that you know what you have and where. Obviously this takes the most time, <br>
many hours, but once you get through that, you'll have much easier time finding what you need when you're typesetting. <br>
In other words, takes time at first, but saves you time later. If you need a specific kind of font and you alreeady have 300 fonts installed<br>
that you have selected as good and suitable, it'll be easy to find one quickly. If you have to go to a website and try looking for something<br>
that would work searching by keywords, it might take long and produce poor results.<br><br>

You can certainly typeset with 20 fonts and get away with it. You will certainly get better results with 400 fonts to choose from.<br>
So it depends on what you're aiming for and how dedicated you actually are to this.<br><br><br>

Before we get to what to use, let me make a few comments on what NOT to use.<br><br>

<b>• Do not use 10 MB fonts!</b><br>
It's stupid to increase a 200 MB mkv's size by 10 MB with just a font. <br>
Mainly for the reason that just about any 10 MB font can easily be replaced with a 100 KB one. 10 MB fonts are only justified for kanji.<br>
My general rule is to not use any fonts over 1 MB. Even fancy decorative fonts are mostly under 1 MB. <br>
Larger fonts are simply bloated with crap you don't need. Not that 2 MB would really be a problem, <br>
but just get used to checking the size to make sure you don't pick those 12 MB ones for no good reason.<br>
<br>

Which leads to another point...<br><br>

<b>• Avoid system fonts, fonts starting with @, MS, Adobe etc. fonts.</b><br>
Not that they're all bad but those often tend to be the large ones and there are always plenty of similar fonts with sane filesizes.<br>
Aegisub has those @ fonts at the top of the list so beginners will choose them 'cause they're first.<br>
Just learn to skip those every time you're choosing a font. There are no "good" ones among them anyway, trust me.<br>
They're only useful if you need kanji. Even if they happen to "fit" what you need, you can always find a similar one that isn't bloated.<br><br>

<b>• Avoid notoriously known fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, ComicSans etc.</b><br>
If you use ComicSans, you will break rizon servers because they will get flooded with <i>>ComicSans</i> messages.<br>
Times New Roman might work sometimes, but it's obviously a severly overused font and you can always find other ones of that kind.<br>
As for Arial, pretty much no japanese sign is so ugly that you could imitate it with Arial.<br><br>

<b>• Basic Serif & Sans Serif fonts...</b> [if you don't know what that means, look it up]<br>
These are not suitable for most signs. Serif fonts may be useful for titles, as seen in the basics chapter.<br>
Basic Sans Serif fonts may be useful for cellphone/e-mail messages, or signs that clearly have no decorative elements whatsoever,<br>
like the Principal's Office sign here:

<br><br>
<img src="principal.jpg"><br><br>
You will, however, need something thicker than Arial [even when bolded] for this, usually ones with Black or Blk in the name.<br>
For most signs you'll want to avoid these basic fonts, as it will look more like you're "putting text on screen," rather than typesetting.<br>
The typesetter's job is to make the signs look good. If we wanted to just put text on screen, we'd do it ourselves instead of hiring you.<br><br>

So what WILL you actually need?<br><br>

<b>• Some better looking [Sans]Serif fonts</b><br>
That means ones that aren't as plain and ugly as Arial and TNR.<br><br>

<b>• LOTS of handwriting fonts</b><br>
Handwriting is all over anime so the more of these you'll have, the better.<br><br>

<b>• Some brush/calligraphy fonts</b><br>
Kanji works great with brushes and the japanese know it. <br>
If you want the typesets for such signs to look really good, you'll need some nice fonts of this kind.<br><br>

<b>• Round/rounded fonts</b><br>
Some with the whole letters being round, some where just the ends are rounded. [Note: Arial Rounded MT Bold looks like shit]<br><br>

<b>• Square fonts</b><br>
...when they use square-ish kanji, obviously.<br><br>

<b>• Chalk/pencil fonts</b><br>
Where would anime be without signs on school blackboards. Better have Eraser Dust and some others ready.<br><br>

<b>• Fonts with eroded outline</b><br>
Meaning ones where the outline isn't clean but kind of jagged and stuff.<br><br>

<b>• Some thick/thin/wide/narrow ones</b><br>
This might as well apply to each category separately. Using \fscx150 doesn't exactly produce the same results as having an actually "wide" font.<br>
Sometimes extremes are needed to either match the original or to fit the sign where you need it.<br><br>

<b>• All kinds of deformed and distorted fonts</b><br>
Not needed most of the time, but if you want to do a really good job on a SHAFT show, it'll be useful to have all kinds of things around.<br>
Blood splatter, ripple effect, various patterns and textures, lightning and wobbly shapes.<br>
No need for beginners but it might still be good to have a few of those around.<br><br>

<b>• Cartoonish fonts</b><br>
These are quite common, so I'd say have as many as possible.<br><br>

<b>• Decorative fonts</b><br>
Some script fonts and whatever fancy stuff you can find. It is kind of hard to predict what you will need, but good to have a few lying around.<br><br>

<b>• Digital looking fonts, ones made out of dots, pixelated ones, typewriter fonts etc.</b><br><br><br>



That about covers the basics. Handwriting is a must, other than that you should have at least 2-3 of each of the other categories.<br>
I usually operate with 350-400 fonts installed, though I have at least 10000 at my disposal.<br>
[A year and a half later, 900 installed and rising.]<br><br>

So that's what you need. Some image examples will follow below.<br><br>

The next step is what to use when. I'd think that would be pretty easy but... I dunno, I've seen enough fails to prove me wrong.<br>
So let's start with an example where I let some guys typeset some Nichijou and we used this Shinonome Laboratory sign to experiment with fonts.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-01.jpg"><br><br>
The first attempt looked like this.<br>
What should be obvious is that the jp sign looks handwritten rather than printed, the outline is kind of free rather than precise, <br>
and it has an overlay pattern. Not that you can easily imitate that pattern but it gives you an idea of the general look you should go for.<br>
Which means this attempt fails quickly. Besides the font mismatch it is poorly positioned and the color doesn't match either.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-02.jpg"><br><br>
Second attempt.<br>
Improvement in color and position, but not so much in font choice.<br>
It doesn't look like a plain typewriter font anymore, ok, but this is still too regular, mathematical, clean, and generally doesn't fit.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-03.jpg"><br><br>
Third attempt [I think].<br>
This has some eroded outline so it's not as clean as the previous ones, but clearly it's almost as fat as the average American.<br>
That's bad, by the way.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-04.jpg"><br><br>
This was, I believe, the last attempt. Eroded outline, some overlay pattern, thickness matches... this passes.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-05.jpg"><br><br>
I hear this was in the actual Commie release. It... doesn't pass. Low budget typesetting edition, I guess.<br><br>

The next few are my examples of fonts that could be used...


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-06.jpg"><br><br>
Oh yeah, I used caps because it seemed to fit better and never tried changing it for the other examples.<br>
While you will mostly get the script in capitalized lowercase, there's really no reason why you couldn't use caps for a sign like this.<br>
So, this works fine.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-07.jpg"><br><br>
This font is squarish, but the thickness matches well enough and it's kinda irregular so... works.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-08.jpg"><br><br>
This is better. It has more space between letters which makes it look less out of place. Might actually be my favorite of these.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-09.jpg"><br><br>
This was just a test to see how Eraser Dust would work. Nothing really great but better than those first attempts up there.<br>
Like, if your font collection is poor, this might be ok.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-10.jpg"><br><br>
This one's pretty irregular and has lines all over the letters, but is a bit too wild. Still acceptable.<br>
In my opinion it's better to make the sign more interesting than more boring. Then again, that should have limits as well.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-11.jpg"><br><br>
...just another font that works.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-12.jpg"><br><br>
This is again going a bit beyond the original but it's much better than plain boring fonts.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-13.jpg"><br><br>
This would be another of my favorites. It has pretty much all the properties of the original and isn't too crazy either.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="ShinoLabs-14.jpg"><br><br>
This was actually the first attempt of another guy in my "TS class" and it's fucking awesome.<br>
Very unintrusive, maybe the best of all examples.<br><br>

The larger your font collection is, the more you have to choose from and the higher chance of your final choice being really good.<br>
If you only have Arial, TNR, ComicSans and other basic stuff, this sign won't look too good.<br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="real1.jpg"><br><br>
This one's from another test. It's too plain and flat.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="real2.jpg"><br><br>
I just changed the font and added a little bit of shadow to make it more 'plastic'.



<br><br>
<img src="idiocy1.jpg"><br><br>
This doesn't look bad, though it lacks blur, but the red font doesn't correspond with the jp one much.<br>
[Also personally I'm a bit tired of chinacat.ttf - the other one]


<br><br>
<img src="idiocy2.jpg"><br><br>
If you have enough fonts, it can make a world of difference.<br>
This red one, btw, is what I meant by 'cartoonish fonts.' Stuff like that.<br>
<font class="n">2015 Note: The red colour is clearly wrong. Also, something could be done about the uneven spaces on each side of "idiocy".</font><br><br>

We've seen this next sign in the Positioning section, here are two random examples of fonts that would work with this.

<br><br>
<img src="mot4.jpg"><br><br>


<br>
<img src="mot5.jpg"><br><br>

You may argue that the original sign isn't really as fancy as the typesets, and you may be right, but I'd say...<br>
I'd rather make the typeset look better than the original then make it look uglier.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="nextday.jpg"><br><br>
This is something you'll definitely come across. A font that looks fairly plain but is rounded at the ends.<br>
This is chinacat again, but here <s>it's just perfect</s>. It's a lot more regular than most handwriting fonts,<br>
and here you can match the size and thickness of the letters to the original really well.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="nextday2.png"><br><br>
Actually no, fuck chinacat. This is how you do it.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="nichioguri.jpg"><br><br>
Children-style handwriting.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="sscj.jpg"><br><br>
One of those chalk fonts. The pattern isn't that visible with small size, but it's good enough.<br>



<br><br>
<img src="soundlife.jpg"><br><br>
Here on the sides you have one of the not-so-plain sans serif fonts.<br>
For the middle sign, the choice of the right font is what will make it look like it belongs there.<br>
It has two layers. Both the black and white are slightly blurred to make it look natural.<br><br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="maria-thud.jpg"><br><br>
This is quite self-explanatory so nothing to say except... I think the editor made a mistake here!<br>
<s>Good thing it hasn't been released yet.</s> Fixed for release.<br><br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="calendar.jpg"><br><br>
Does this work? I think it does.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="ready.jpg"><br><br>
Sometimes you just find exactly the right font...
<br><br><br>


Now a few things about what plain standard japanese fonts look like, ie where you should use plain fonts too.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="sans01.jpg"><br><br>
This is an ordinary sans serif font.<br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="sans02.jpg"><br><br>
Same here. Adjust the size so that it matches the thickness, match color, add blur, done.<br>
Well, almost, 'cause you need \frz and most likely some \fax.<br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="sans03a.jpg"><br><br>
Here you have bold serif at the top right and bold sans serif below.<br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="sans03b2.jpg"><br><br>
No space for the five, so you have to mask it, but you can get quite close to the original.<br><br>


<br><br>
<img src="sans04.jpg"><br><br>
Simple sans serif bold/heavy/black. The border gets brighter to the right, so you can change the color for each word.<br>
Also contains: little bit of \fry and \org, and of course blur and two layers.<br><br>



<br><br>
<img src="serif01.jpg"><br><br>
Ordinary serif font. This one's thinner than usual but since the typeset is much smaller,<br>
making it thinner wouldn't look too good here.<br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="serif02.jpg"><br><br>
This is quite typical serif.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="serif03.jpg"><br><br>
This may be a bit more rounded but I think it's mostly because <br>
it's hiragana as opposed to kanji in the previous example.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="serif03b.jpg"><br><br>
You could use somethnig more round...<br>

<br><br>
<img src="serif03c.jpg"><br><br>
...or something a bit more fancy. But the first one works.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="serif04v2.jpg"><br><br>
Another serif font but this one's thinner and taller.<br>
Also play with border/blur/color on the bottom layer until you get it right.<br>
You might wanna go for more perfection with episode titles since it's gonna be used in all episodes, so it might as well look really good.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="serif05.jpg"><br><br>
This is kind of half-serif.<br>
There are several things you should consider when picking a font for something like this.<br>
Height/width and overall thickness. This should be obvious.<br>
Then there's the ratio of horizontal vs vertical thickness. You can see the vertical lines are thicker than the horizontal ones.<br>
That is usually the case, except for simple sans serif like the "Defence Force" sign above.<br>
The ratio may differ though. On the red one just above the difference between horizontal and vertical lines isn't big.<br>
But on the "Priestess..." higher up the horizontal lines are really thin.<br>
Here on the "Vanishing Children" there are no really thin lines. So you should try to match that.<br>
The last thing that will determine whether the font matches or not is the ends of the letters. This of course makes the serif/sans difference.<br>
The serif endings may vary a lot though.<br>
They can be sharp/pointy in various ways [Garamond, Footlight, Timpani], less so like Raleigh [Gregorian Calendar sign above] or Arno Pro,<br>
rounded [Cooper, Souvenir], short/heavy/square-ish [Acclaim, Albertus, Strayhorn, GeoSlab(numbers)] or with some decorations [Zapf Chancery].<br>
So here for "Vanishing Children" you need serif where the endings aren't too pronounced and horizontal lines are thinner than vertical but not too thin.<br>
I think the choice here is pretty much perfect.



<br><br><br>
A few typical serif examples if you have no clue what to look for:<br>
[Not Times New Roman], Garamond, Goudy Old Style, New Baskerville, Georgia, Thames, Palatino
<br><br>
A few typical sans serif examples:<br>
[Not Arial], Franklin Gothic, Myriad Pro, Zurich, Frutiger, Liberation Sans
<br><br><br>

<br><br>
<img src="shinsekai-500.jpg"><br><br>
This font is very "open," with a lot of space between the lines and [almost] the same thickness of all lines.<br>
A characteristic feature here is that the zero has the same width as height.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="shinsekai-river.jpg"><br><br>
Here the japanese is a bit closer to handwriting but handwriting or brush fonts would be too messy.<br>
The font I used has that varying thickness and the ends of letters fit pretty well.<br>


<br><br>
<img src="shinsekai-names.jpg"><br><br>
This shouldn't need any comment.

<br><br>
<img src="shinsekai-titles.jpg"><br><br>
I like typesetting Shinsekai Yori because it has new challenges every episode.<br>
These are titles from episodes 1 and 2.<br>

<br><br>
<img src="shinsekai-redtitle.jpg"><br><br>
And this is from episode 3. I have no idea how all these moonrunes are even readable.
<br><br><br>

A few examples from Muromi-san:

<br><br>
<img src="point.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<img src="fontmuromi01.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<img src="fontmuromi02.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<img src="fontmuromi03.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<img src="fontmuromi04.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<img src="fontmuromi05.jpg"><br><br>

<br>
Just imagine how bad they would look with Arial...
