Sometimes I find that some people really don't understand how this font business works and then do weird things.
<br><br>

<i><b>What is a font?</i></b><br>
Font is an awesome thing that brings letters on your screen. There are other things that can bring letters on your screen, like pixels or lipstick, but they are a lot less awesome.<br><br>

<i><b>How does it work?</i></b><br>
It's a file with a character map ensuring that if you hit for example the F key on your keyboard, you get the letter F to show up on your screen 10 times out of 10 [when you're actually typing letters and not playing your stupid games], rather than some random letter, and you get that same letter even if you use another font! Awesome, right?<br><br>

<i><b>I don't know. Why is it so awesome?</i></b><br>
What a stupid question! I won't even answer it. Anyway, the glyphs for letters are stored as vector graphics, so even if you make the letters a lot bigger, you don't get just bigger pixels, but instead still smooth letters. There are [probably] millions of fonts and some of them are even more awesome than others, because they actually don't look like shit.<br><br>

<i><b>OK, but why are you telling me all this?</i></b><br>
Because we're in the business of making subtitles, and those are basically long streams of letters, and those letters come from fonts. So if you wanna join us, especially as a typesetter, you'd better understand what a fucking font is and how it works, otherwise you'll ask me stupid questions like "but why do i have to upload the fonts? they are already in aegisub! can't you just take them from there??"<br><br>

<i><b>So where would I get one of these fonts?</i></b><br>
Same place where you get everythnig else, obviously. No, I don't mean the supermarket, I'm talking about the internet, duh. And you'd better get a lot more than just one. This is not Doki or Hadena. <br>
The internet has things like websites and also torrents, and sometimes even search engines. If you still can't find fonts after what I just said, you're fired.<br><br>

<i><b>So I downloaded some of these fonts. How do I use them?</i></b><br>
You install them. This can be done by various means. Depending on your OS putting them in windows/fonts may be enough. If not, google how to install fonts, or get a font manager.<br><br>

<i><b>What's a font manager?</i></b><br>
Google it, goddammit. Seriously...<br><br>

<i><b>OK, so I install them. Then what?</i></b><br>
Then your OS and programs that use fonts are aware of them and can use them. Since we're generally dealing with aegisub here, the simple connection is that you can use in aegisub whatever font you have installed, while you can not use ones that you don't have installed. Therefore please notice the interesting fact, that just because you see some font on the list in your aegisub, doesn't mean that other people see the same on their own computers with completely different installed fonts. The fonts are not "in aegisub."<br><br>

<i><b>Yeah, whatever, so what does it mean for me?</i></b><br>
It means that if you typeset something with some fonts and you want others to actually see the typesetting with those fonts, you have to make sure they have those fonts as well. There are two ways to do it. Either tell them to get the fonts themselves, or pass the fonts to them in an efficient way. The former is fucking retarded. Making thousands of people look for a bunch of fonts just cause you're lazy to upload them would not only be incredibly lame of you, but would also fail terribly, because other people are lazy too, not mentioning retarded. So we go with the latter.<br><br>

<i><b>Wait! But how do I give my fonts to thousands of people? That sounds like a lot of work!</i></b><br>
Not really. You just upload the fonts and we take care of it. We use magic to put the fonts into the mkv people will be downloading, so they get the fonts along with the video and subs.<br><br>

<i><b>Phew, thank god. I was already thinking about quitting. But don't all those people have to install the fonts?</i></b><br>
I'm amazed you made that connection! [Well, you didn't really, but let's pretend you did.] Yes, the fonts need to be installed, but fortunately this is automated and the fonts get temporarily installed when you open the video, and uninstalled again when you close it. You will notice that when you open such a video in a player, you'll see the fonts in aegisub, but when you close the video, the fonts are gone again.<br><br>

<i><b>Wow, I never knew about this magic. I just kind of assumed it all just worked on its own.</i></b><br>
If only things were that simple...<br><br><br>
