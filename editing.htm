<center>General Guidelines</center>
<hr size=1>
 <br>
Use American English and proper grammar<br>
—"Italicize," "realize," "honor," "color," etc.<br>
—"Toward" and "afterward" rather than "towards" and "afterwards."<br>
—An exception to the American English rule is quotation marks. Just do it right if you are going to use American or British English style for quotation marks.<br>
—An exception to the proper grammar rule would be if you wanted to accurately portray a speech impediment, an accent, a dialect, and so on. In such cases, it may be necessary and possibly even encouraged to use unconventional English.<br>
 <br>
Use "All right" instead of "alright."<br>
 <br>
Use "Okay" or "okay" instead of "OK," "Ok," or "ok."<br>
 <br>
Use contractions as often as possible and as appropriate. Just make sure it reads well before changing.<br>
—Ex.: "I would've done things differently" vs. "I'd have done things differently" vs. "I would have done things differently."<br>
 <br>
Prefer localization over literal translations. The dialogue should read as smoothly as the show intends.<br>
—Ex.: "It can't be helped" could instead be "I have no choice," "It's no use," or "Shit happens."<br>
—If something reads like shit, change it. Remember, though, that you are NOT a scriptwriter. Don't make changes unless you are sure your line means what it should mean.<br>
—A general rule for Japanese-y words: If you can't find a word in the dictionary (Dictionary.com or Merriam-Webster), it should be localized or translated.<br>
 <br>
Nuke honorifics and localize them appropriately.<br>
—Generally, this means getting rid of -chan/-kun. -san could be eliminated or changed to Mr. or Mrs. depending on context.<br>
— -sensei should be Mr./Teacher/Professor etc.<br>
 <br>
Names should be written how they are spoken.<br>
—That usually means surname followed by first name.<br>
—An exception may be a show that very obviously takes place in America, but the above rule should take care of everything.<br>
 <br>
If someone is speaking and he is not at the scene, italicize his dialogue.<br>
 <br>
No semicolons.<br>
 <br>
No double hyphens. Use an em-dash for interrupted dialogue: Alt+0151 gives "—"<br>
 <br>
Use a spellchecker.<br>
 <br>
For stuttering, keep the capitalization of the repeated letter or syllable. Examples:<br>
—"D-Don't look at me!"<br>
—"It's so c-cold."<br>
 <br>
 <br>

<center>Helpful Hints</center>
<hr size=1>
 <br>
Comments in .ass files are enclosed by curly brackets "{" and "}"<br>
—Ex.: {this will not show up on the actual video}<br>
 <br>
Here are some useful tags:<br>
—"{\an8}" moves a line of text to the top center of the screen. <a href="ts/macro-8-an8.lua">Aegisub script</a><br>
—"{\i1}" makes text italics until it reaches "{\i0}" or the end of a line. <a href="ts/macro-italicize.lua">Aegisub script</a><br>
<br>
 <br>
You can edit scripts in Notepad, an EtherPad, or Aegisub.<br><br><br>
