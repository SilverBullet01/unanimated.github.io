[01:05:45] &lt;unanimated&gt; can anyone explain to me what this means?  http://i.imgur.com/phB2L0b.jpg<br>
[01:05:49] &lt;unanimated&gt; i wonder if i'm just dumb<br>
[01:06:00] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; it obviously means<br>
[01:06:04] &lt;unanimated&gt; that line is fucking with my brain<br>
[01:06:11] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; "I could go easy on someone, but the extent of which is out of my hands."<br>
[01:06:47] &lt;Capnpaddy&gt; The extent of how easy they go is out of her hands?<br>
[01:07:14] &lt;unanimated&gt; that would be "the extent of that" imo<br>
[01:07:22] &lt;Juular&gt; thinik it's someone trying to be pretentious<br>
[01:07:32] &lt;Juular&gt; (surprise)<br>
[01:07:49] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; i think its horrible editing<br>
[01:08:03] &lt;Juular&gt; who all worked on that anyway<br>
[01:08:15] &lt;unanimated&gt; what do you mean by "all"<br>
[01:08:22] &lt;Juular&gt; also her face has some QUALITY<br>
[01:08:30] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; its like<br>
[01:08:32] &lt;Juular&gt; edited, tl<br>
[01:08:33] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; y'all<br>
[01:08:33] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; but<br>
[01:08:36] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; who'll<br>
[01:08:49] &lt;unanimated&gt; i think TL was still vale on this<br>
[01:08:53] &lt;unanimated&gt; editing Csiko<br>
[01:09:11] &lt;Juular&gt; ic<br>
[01:10:48] &lt;herkz&gt; she has no control over how easy she goes on someone?<br>
[01:10:59] &lt;herkz&gt; also there's nothing wrong with that line<br>
[01:11:02] &lt;herkz&gt; also futsuu translated it<br>
[01:11:41] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; i think<br>
[01:11:45] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; it would be better as<br>
[01:11:52] &lt;unanimated&gt; idk what "which" is doing there<br>
[01:11:56] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; "... but the extent to which I do so is out of my hands"<br>
[01:12:05] &lt;herkz&gt; of which (I go easy on someone) etc<br>
[01:12:08] &lt;unanimated&gt; that would make sense<br>
[01:12:13] &lt;herkz&gt; that would make it pointlessly long<br>
[01:12:18] &lt;herkz&gt; it doesn't need those details<br>
[01:12:20] &lt;herkz&gt; they're implied<br>
[01:12:21] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; i think its just "of" which is weird<br>
[01:12:24] &lt;unanimated&gt; which would be ok if there wasn't a 'but' and it ended differently<br>
[01:12:25] &lt;herkz&gt; (to people that know english, anyway)<br>
[01:14:19] &lt;Konbini&gt; &lt;&unanimated&gt; can anyone explain to me what this means?  http://i.imgur.com/phB2L0b.jpg<br>
[01:14:22] &lt;Konbini&gt; stop trying to break me please<br>
[01:14:31] &lt;Capnpaddy&gt; Can't sub things and expect the audience to know english<br>
[01:14:46] &lt;herkz&gt; yeah, need more japanese<br>
[01:14:54] &lt;herkz&gt; leechers seem to understand japanese better than english at times<br>
[01:15:08] &lt;Juular&gt; or think they do<br>
<br>
[01:25:23] &lt;Csiko&gt; unless that's some kind of weird Britishism<br>
[01:25:31] &lt;Csiko&gt; it's extent of which<br>
[01:26:08] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; idk dont ask me i hate english it just sounds weird to me<br>
[01:26:11] &lt;unanimated&gt; "the extent of which" is fine, but this is not how it's used, imo<br>
[01:26:24] &lt;herkz&gt; that is how it's used<br>
[01:26:24] &lt;herkz&gt; wtf<br>
[01:26:28] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; i just think that since its like<br>
[01:26:32] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; youre doing something<br>
[01:26:41] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; you do it "to" an extent<br>
[01:27:11] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; what is the sentence?<br>
[01:27:19] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; http://i.imgur.com/phB2L0b.jpg<br>
[01:28:11] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; honestly, speaking from an english speakers standpoint<br>
[01:28:26] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; that sentence makes no grammatical sense<br>
[01:29:06] &lt;Aoi-chan&gt; you can infer what it means but its structured awkwardly<br>
[01:30:41] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; the "which" really doesn't work; its a pronoun not any kind of quantitative measure relating to extent<br>
[01:31:05] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; or rather "easy"<br>
[01:31:06] &lt;herkz&gt; it does<br>
[01:31:21] &lt;herkz&gt; it's "which I go easy on someone"<br>
[01:31:59] &lt;herkz&gt; but having "I go easy on someone" twice in the sentence would be stupid<br>
[01:32:02] &lt;herkz&gt; so it was removed<br>
[01:32:08] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; does it mean "the extent of how easy is out of my hand"?<br>
[01:32:10] &lt;unanimated&gt; imo 'but" should join two independent clauses<br>
[01:32:30] &lt;unanimated&gt; "the extent of which is out of my hands" is not a sentence<br>
[01:32:31] &lt;herkz&gt; it does<br>
[01:32:39] &lt;herkz&gt; it is<br>
[01:32:50] &lt;herkz&gt; it's meaningless by itself<br>
[01:32:53] &lt;unanimated&gt; it's not a complete sentence<br>
[01:32:57] &lt;herkz&gt; it is<br>
[01:33:00] &lt;herkz&gt; wtf<br>
[01:33:14] &lt;unanimated&gt; there's nothing that "which" relates to here<br>
[01:33:23] &lt;herkz&gt; and that's not required<br>
[01:33:32] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; i thought it related to extent?<br>
[01:33:55] &lt;unanimated&gt; but extent of what?<br>
[01:34:02] &lt;herkz&gt; doesn't matter<br>
[01:34:08] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; extent of "going easy"?<br>
[01:34:17] &lt;unanimated&gt; that's not in the sentence<br>
[01:34:21] &lt;herkz&gt; like i said, it makes no sense until you put it with the other sentence<br>
[01:34:21] &lt;unanimated&gt; &lt;unanimated&gt; "the extent of which is out of my hands" is not a sentence<br>
[01:34:25] &lt;herkz&gt; but repeating it twice is retarded<br>
[01:34:30] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; did you change it?<br>
[01:34:32] &lt;herkz&gt; therefore, you end up with that picture<br>
[01:34:42] &lt;RaceOfAce&gt; ah i see<br>
[01:34:59] &lt;herkz&gt; this really is pretty straightforward<br>
[01:35:08] &lt;herkz&gt; i mean, thinking there's a better way to phrase it is not the issue<br>
[01:35:09] &lt;unanimated&gt; i think an independent clause should make sense on its own<br>
[01:35:12] &lt;herkz&gt; saying it's wrong or something is<br>
[01:35:19] &lt;herkz&gt; well that's a nice opinion you have<br>
[01:35:30] &lt;Aoi-chan&gt; isn't that what an IC is<br>
[01:35:31] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; i mean<br>
[01:35:32] &lt;herkz&gt; there's no rule it has to make sense<br>
[01:35:34] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; technically<br>
[01:35:35] &lt;Aoi-chan&gt; because if it doesn't it's a DC<br>
[01:35:36] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; it is a sentence<br>
[01:35:38] &lt;herkz&gt; it just needs a subject and a verb<br>
[01:35:40] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; "extent of which"<br>
[01:35:43] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; is like the noun<br>
[01:35:46] &lt;unanimated&gt; &gt; An independent clause (or main clause) is a clause that can stand by itself, also known as a simple sentence. An independent clause contains a subject and a predicate; it makes sense by itself.<br>
[01:35:58] &lt;herkz&gt; it does make sense<br>
[01:36:00] &lt;faggosaurus&gt; but then again fuck english im a biochem major<br>
[01:36:02] &lt;herkz&gt; it just refers to the previous line<br>
[01:36:07] &lt;unanimated&gt; ...<br>
[01:36:19] &lt;herkz&gt; it leaves out details that are implied?<br>
[01:36:22] &lt;herkz&gt; what is the issue here<br>
[01:36:49] &lt;herkz&gt; like i said, putting that info twice would be retarded<br>
[01:36:52] &lt;unanimated&gt; they are only implied by the other sentence<br>
[01:36:55] &lt;herkz&gt; so i have no idea what you think is a better solution<br>
[01:37:02] &lt;unanimated&gt; it makes no sense on its own<br>
[01:37:10] &lt;herkz&gt; good thing it is not on its own then, huh?<br>
[01:37:33] &lt;unanimated&gt; wow you really are retarded<br>
[01:37:34] &lt;unanimated&gt; nvm<br>
[01:37:38] &lt;herkz&gt; no<br>
[01:37:43] &lt;herkz&gt; i actually know how english works<br>
[01:38:02] &lt;herkz&gt; you don't have to follow rules like that to the letter<br>
[01:38:06] &lt;herkz&gt; that's not how people actually talk<br>
[01:38:13] &lt;herkz&gt; this isn't an english test<br>
[01:38:52] &lt;herkz&gt; maybe after you realize that people bend the rules constant you'll have a better understanding of the language<br>
[01:38:57] &lt;herkz&gt; constantly<br><br><br>

Sadly, this really happened. Some people believe that you don't have to folow rules like "an independent clause must make sense on its own", even though that's what makes it an independent clause. I felt it was required to <a href="but-the-extent-of-which.htm">explain a few things.</a>
