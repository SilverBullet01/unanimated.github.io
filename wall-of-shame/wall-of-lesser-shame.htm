While the original Wall of Shame contains things that should be obvious without explanation, I come across a lot of smaller mistakes, and since Commie stubbornly refuses to QC stuff, claiming it's not useful, I'm gonna post evidence to the contrary.<br>
Some of the things posted here may be just poor editing rather than grammatical mistakes.

I had to separate herkz even here, since his contribution is much larger than all the others' combined.

Genius. This was supposedly on purpose. Probably not even intended as trolling.<br>
So anyway, this is a pretty lame thing to do in subtitles, and even if it was intentional, he still screwed it up. The "he" would have to be [you] as well. Either quote it properly, or paraphrase it.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs02.jpg"><br><br>
I have it on good authority that the word is "ruder".
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs03.jpg"><br><br>
"compared to me she's better than me"?<br>
Try one of these instead:<br>
"Compared to me when I was just starting, she's way better."<br>
"She's way better than me when I was just starting."
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs04.jpg"><br><br>
This line would work for Hasebe, but Miyoshi speaks more properly than most of the others, so this doesn't fit her character.<br>
Of course, brainchild is notoriously known to utterly and completely (yes, <i>that</i> much) ignore characters' personality.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs05.jpg"><br><br>
I don't think he's the manager of the stuffed animal section. It might work better with different wording.<br>
Plush/plushie section manager? Or at least "stuffed-animal section manager".<br>
I'm surprised he didn't go with "section manager puppet".<br>
(For those who don't know, for certain reasons, the section manager actually is a stuffed animal.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs06.jpg">
<img src="sxs07.jpg"><br><br>
Now, this is not necessarily a grammatically wrong sentence in itself, but the meaning with the comma after "out" is different from the meaing intended. Not getting in her way is not a random consequence; it's the purpose.<br>
Comma: "...I'm usually out here zoning out [and thanks to that, I don't get in her way]"<br>
Not comma: "...I'm usually out here zoning out [in order to avoid getting in her way]"<br>
Also, "<b>out</b> here zoning <b>out</b>" is not that great.<br>
Also, "She's probably home, so I'm usually..." doesn't make sense.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs08.jpg"><br><br>
Most people use contractions because it makes speech shorter.<br>
Brainchild does it (often with them not making anything shorter or being unpronounceable) 'cause he thinks it makes him cool.<br>
This one's pronounced "thererrrRRR".
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs09.jpg"><br><br>
This one is "thingzzzvvv".
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs10.jpg"><br><br>
This one sounds like (a) geyser.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs11.jpg">
<img src="sxs12.jpg"><br><br>
Am I gonna contract everything I can? Absolutely! ('cause'm so'wesom')<br>
Am I gonna consider the character's personality and whether they'd actually say it? FUCK NO!
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs13.jpg"><br><br>
I'm sure the word "supermarket" evolved from "super market" at some point, but I'm also pretty sure we settled on "supermarket" long ago.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs14.jpg"><br><br>
That makes five misplaced commas (including main Wall of Shame) and counting.<br>
"Since" without a comma would imply "from the time when". This one, however, means "because".<br>
It's a rare case, just as it's rare to have a comma before "because", but it should be used to prevent misreading.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs15.jpg">
<img src="sxs16.jpg"><br><br>
There are many ways to split a line. You, sir, are doing it wrong.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs17.jpg">
<img src="sxs18.jpg"><br><br>
Seriously, I don't know if he's doing it on purpose. Sure, it's technically not a "mistake", but it adds to or detracts from the flow of the script. It also shows whether the editor actually cares about the quality of the script or just doesn't give a fuck.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs19.jpg">
<img src="sxs20.jpg"><br><br>
I kind of understand that services with shitty players, like CR, have to split by line length sometimes, but this has no purpose and no logical reason.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs21.jpg"><br><br>
So at the same time when good things can cause huge regrets (I don't know when that will be), something will be good later.<br>
This is pretty FUBAR. If I'm getting right what the meaning should be, it should probably go like this:<br>
It'll Be Good Later. At the Same Time, Good Things Can Cause Huge Regrets."<br>
Alternatively, they could be joined with a "but" or "and".<br>
Anyway, this prompted me to go back and check the other episode titles.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs22.jpg"><br><br>
...<br>
A feeling so complicated...
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs23.jpg"><br><br>
Dear Self-Prevention, there are people where you can't see (period [and some other stuff] omitted)
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs24.jpg"><br><br>
I suppose we can examine hide-and-seek, though I'm not so sure it was the intention. I had the title TLCed, and apparently, it doesn't make any sense in Japanese either, so I'll let this one slip.
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs25.jpg"><br><br>
The title is awkwardly phrased at the very least.<br>
Also, period is the new exclamation mark, and empty space is the new period.<br>
No, seriously. The first one is OK, but if you have a period in the middle, why is there none at the end?
<br><br><br>
<img src="sxs26.jpg"><br><br>
Just another weird title. Move along.
<br><br><br>
<img src="kc01.jpg"><br><br>
This should be "to whom". It's an object.
<br><br><br>
<img src="kc02.jpg"><br><br>
I don't know why you'd use "whoever" instead of "who" here. It doesn't make much sense. This way, it reads like, "Whoever the person that confesses to me is, and whoever the person I reject is, they are none of your business."<br>
What's not her business is not the people but Iori's involvement with them.
<br><br><br>
<img src="kc03.jpg"><br><br>
I can't figure out what you were trying to say by changing "We need to finish before post-exam vacations!" to this.<br>
This wording just doesn't make any sense.

It's not exactly a mistake, but Hanekawa and Senjougahara speak very properly, so this is quite out of character.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko02.jpg"><br><br>
Same here.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko03.jpg"><br><br>
I don't think this was the best way of inserting the "or maybe not" part. Em-dashes seem like the obvious solution.<br>
Even commas would work better than this.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko04.jpg">
<img src="neko05.jpg">
<img src="neko06.jpg"><br><br>
As many people don't seem to realize, "then" is not a conjunction, so this is wrong.<br>
Also, this is a list of 3 things, so there should be no "I" in the third one.<br>
The elements of lists should always be parallel in construction.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko07.jpg">
<img src="neko08.jpg"><br><br>
No comma. Also, if you want to emphasize the "had", it would be better as "<i>did</i> have".
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko09.jpg"><br><br>
This sentence is a bit complicated and unclear. What exactly does the last part tie into?<br>
"person who'd hang out / person who'd refuse to hang out / person who'd refuse to let anyone hang out"?<br>
You can eliminate the first option by changing "or hang out" to "or to hang out".<br>
It might also help to move things around:<br>
"You thought I was the kinda person who'd refuse to hang out with someone outside school or (to) let them into her room?"<br>
(But a nice 3-liner.) Also, Hanekawa wouldn't say "kinda".
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko10.jpg"><br><br>
The streaming tears weren't what she got slapped with. To make it clear, use a comma or alter the syntax.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko11.jpg">
<img src="neko12.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko13.jpg"><br><br>
Again, "then" is not a conjunction here. It's either "shower. Then" or "shower, and then".
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko14.jpg"><br><br>
...as opposed to sleep now? This would benefit from a comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko15.jpg"><br><br>
How about this later, Senjougahara? Similar case.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko16.jpg">
<img src="neko17.jpg"><br><br>
Rather meaningles interjections like this may be up for debate regarding commas, but there should at least be some consistency.
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko18.jpg"><br><br>
As Hanekawa speaks properly, this should be "my meeting the tiger".
<br><br><br>
<img src="neko19.jpg"><br><br>
This is not really a mistake, but from an editing standpoint, it could use some improvement:<br>
"That's why I'm uttering these words for the fitst time in my life..."
<br><br><br>
<img src="monogatari01.jpg">
<img src="monogatari02.jpg"><br><br>
"From the time a signal turns red, to the time the signals perpendicular to it turn green, there's about three seconds of time lag."<br>
I don't see why there should be a comma after "red".
<br><br><br>
<img src="monogatari03.jpg"><br><br>
"No wait" without a comma is pretty weird.
<br><br><br>
<img src="monogatari04.jpg"><br><br>
Comma splice.
<br><br><br>
<img src="monogatari05.jpg"><br><br>
Nothing wrong with the line, but why would you have such terrible linebreaks? -_-
<br><br><br>

The Japanese audio has 8 words. This translation/edit has 19 words and is totally unreadable in the 2 seconds it gets.<br>

DxS, just like herkz and others in Commie, thinks that "then" is a conjunction. It's not.

Again, "then" is not a conjunction. "I'll try it and <i>then</i> bash it."<br>
Alternatively: "I'll try it. <i>Then(,)</i> I'll bash it."
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai06.jpg"><br><br>
This misuse of a comma is so pathetic it's painful to watch. (<-- hint) Not only does herkz do it all the goddamn time, but others seem to be having trouble with this too.

Oh man, here we go. The subs were pretty decent so far, but episode 6 had like half of the mistakes from the whole show, largely due to having no clue what to do with EME.<br>
You start with "Thou art" but end with "are ye". How does that make any sense?<br>
Obviously, the ending needs to be "art thou not".<br>
"Thou art" is singular; "ye are" is plural.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai12.jpg"><br><br>
Since thou decided to use EME, thou hast no choice but follow through with it. A clue for thee hath been included.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai13.jpg"><br><br>
Thou hast not been able to learn the forms of verbs used with "thou".
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai14.jpg"><br><br>
I was considering pointing out that "thy own" should be "thine own", since "own" starts with a vowel, but I dropped it, as it's not entirely true. The usage of both variants has been allowed, historically. However...
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai16.jpg"><br><br>
...you then had to go and use "thine" before a consonant, which doesn't make any sense. You should either do it the other way round, or use "thy" everywhere (except "this is thine").
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai15.jpg"><br><br>
"Last but not least"
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai17.jpg"><br><br>
thy ... thy
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai18.jpg"><br><br>
thy
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai19.jpg"><br><br>
"If thou dost this without spilling the water, the moon shall bless thee,"
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai20.jpg"><br><br>
...which is funny because you got it right here. If you have no idea what you're doing, at least try to do it consistently.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai21.jpg"><br><br>
This is a comma splice. It's not terrible, but it's not great either.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai22.jpg"><br><br>
I would recommend "life-and-death struggle". Otherwise, it can be misread as "long and terrifying life" and "death struggle".<br>
(The linebreak helps, but it's not like it's intentional, is it?)
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai23.jpg"><br><br>
Another comma splice. No big deal. Just saying.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai24.jpg"><br><br>
You're definitely missing a comma here, and I hope I don't have to tell you where.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai26.jpg"><br><br>
Comma before "and".
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai27.jpg"><br><br>
The "around forever" part could be phrased better, like "Stop dragging your past around all the time".<br>
Also, there should be a comma before "and".
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai28.jpg"><br><br>
The second line is a new sentence and thus should be capitalized.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai29.jpg"><br><br>
Comma after "well".
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai30.jpg"><br><br>
Comma after "back". Not entirely necessary, but it would be a lot better.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai31.jpg"><br><br>
This definitely needs a comma after "snacks", unless you're trying to say that after Maria eats snacks, she eats leaves.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai32.jpg"><br><br>
You have contracted the Commie Contracting Disease. Contractions are not always better. Somebody who uses "for" in place of "because" will most likely not contract "I am". It sounds pretty dumb when you say it out loud.
<br><br><br>
<img src="haganai33.jpg"><br><br>
Any more of <i>this'd be bad</i>'d be really bad. I don't know what's so cool about making contractions that are harder to pronounce than the full version.

I suppose this is not completely out of the question, but at least a comma after "now" would be nice.
<br><br><br>
<img src="watamote05.jpg"><br><br>
missing a period
<br><br><br>
<img src="watamote06.jpg"><br><br>
With the comma, it sounds like "I'll tell them no matter what", but I'm pretty sure from context that the meaning was "to not come into my room no matter what".
<br><br><br>
<img src="watamote07.jpg"><br><br>
This can be read as "I heard they can make slice of life anime only because regulations are so strict nowadays."<br>
In other words, without strict regulations, they couldn't make SOL anime.<br>
But what she's saying is that because of the regulations, they can only make SOL and not other kinds of anime.<br>
Therefore, a comma after "anime" would help, and in fact, move the "nowadays" after "anime".<br>
It should probably also be "I've heard" since there's no reference time given. It should also definitely be "slice-of-life anime".<br>
<b>"I've heard they can only make slice-of-life anime nowadays, because regulations are so strict."</b><br>
If you move the "nowadays", the comma isn't really that important anymore since the misreading is a lot less likely that way.

<br><br><br>
<img src="watamote30.jpg"><br><br>
I suppose you could argue that this could be nonrestrictive, but I think it makes more sense as restrictive, without the comma.<br>
Also, it's "near-death experience".

"doubt there's any eight-grader who knows more ... than I do"<br>
"doubt there's any other eight-grader who knows as much ... as I do"<br>
If you use "any other ... who knows more", then you're saying there already is one (or more) who know(s) more (than I do).
