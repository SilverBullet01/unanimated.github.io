It appears that I can't repeat this often enough, so here goes...<br><br>

There are several things you need to remember about using blur:<br><br>

<b>1. Always use it.</b><br>
Signs are just not gonna look good without it.<br><br>

<b>2. Don't screw up the tags</b><br>
Don't use \blur.5 instead of \blur0.5.<br><br>

<b>3. Don't use blur0.3 or lower because it dosen't do anything.</b><br>
You could actually see this if you looked at the screen, but apparently people don't look at what they're doing.<br><br>

<b>4. Always check your signs at 100%</b><br>
Otherwise the signs get blurred by resizing and you can't see how much blur you need.<br><br>

<b>5. Learn how to do blur right for signs with border.</b><br>
Read the Layers chapter in the guide. Read the Layers chapter in the guide. I'm saying it twice because you keep missing it.<br><br><br>
