Alpha Timing is a practice used to make some parts of text appear later than others.<br>
Some groups started to use it for dialogue lines that had a pause in them.<br><br>

For example a line like "Are you... serious?" would have a pause in the middle.<br>
With regular timing you can read the rest of the line before the character says it,<br>
which can sometines reduce dramatic effect, so you may want to avoid it,<br>
and splitting this into 2 lines might be a bit too weird.<br><br>

So what you do is make the "serious" part appear only when the character says it,<br>
while the start of the sentence stays in the same place. The way to do it is this:<br><br>

Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you... {\alpha&HFF&}serious?<br>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.00,0:00:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you... serious?<br><br>

First line timed to first second, second to the second (no puns intended).<br>
Basically it makes the latter part of the line invisible, but since it's technically there,<br>
you don't have to change the positioning of the line.<br><br>

Sometimes this is also useful for typesetting, like when a period or an exclamation mark<br>
appear later than the rest of the text.<br><br><br>

Of course this also works with more than just 2 segments:<br><br>

Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Weird{\alpha&HFF&}...<br>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.00,0:00:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Weird.{\alpha&HFF&}..<br>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.98,0:00:02.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Weird..{\alpha&HFF&}.<br>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.98,0:00:03.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Weird...<br><br><br>


Be aware that a lot of people hate alpha timing for dialogue, mainly because some groups,<br>
like Lunar, abused the shit out of it and used it almost like karaoke.
