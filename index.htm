If you're wondering who this unanimated no yatsu is, here's a few answers.<br><br><br>

• Head of <a href="itw/index.htm">Irrational Typesetting Wizardry</a>, whatever that is<br><br>

• Typesetter (Vivid, Interrobang?!, Commie)<br><br>
• Timer (Vivid, Interrobang?!)<br><br>
• Occasional editor, mainly for Commie's Panzerfahren because it was fun<br><br>

Nope, not in any other groups. I typeset Minami-ke S4 for UTW but was never part of the group.<br>
Curiously enough, I also timed one episode for Eclipse, though they never released it<br>
(and probably never will) because they're dead.<br><br>

• Author of the <a href="ts/index.htm">best typesetting guide</a> there is<br>
No, I don't know if that's really true, but if you know of a better one, let me know.<br>
(The triple occurence of the word 'know' in the previous sentence is purely coincidental)<br><br>

• Author of <a href="timing-basics.htm">this timing guide</a><br><br>


• Co-founder of <a href="vivid/index.htm">Vivid Subs</a> (with Xythar)<br><br>

• One of the oldest active fansubbers (as in age, not time spent fansubbing)<br><br>

• Author of a few dozen awesome <a href="ts/scripts-unanimated.htm">automation scripts</a> for Aegisub<br><br>

• Ex-Chief-Tormentor in Commie's bootcamp<br>
This includes for example leading the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Aioo9Sw.jpg">Antichrist of Softsubs</a> to his current glory.<br><br>

• The guy who finished typesetting Maria Fucking Where (eps 6-12)<br>
This was then delayed by a nigger called RHExcelion for another 6 months because QC is too hard.<br>
Also, Maria is still by far the best show I had the honour of typesetting... I wish there was more.<br><br>

• The only person who enjoyed typesetting Acchi Kocchi<br>
The others were all in Tsumiki - I think there were like 5 or 6.<br><br>

• The person maintaining the <a href="wall-of-shame/index.htm">Commie Wall(s) of Shame</a><br><br>

• Somebody who can explain to you <a href="commie-vs-vivid.htm">the difference between Commie and Vivid</a><br><br>

• Author of some other, less important <a href="guides.htm">guides</a>, like <a href="mkvtools/index.htm">this one</a> or <a href="kvirc.htm">that one</a> or <a href="xdelta.htm">that other one</a><br><br>

• The person responsible for <a href="px/horizon-subs.gif">this</a>, <a href="ts/Nise-books01.png">this</a>, <a href="px/horizon-cr.jpg">this</a>, and other things
