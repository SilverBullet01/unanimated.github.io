Hello, useless maggots.<br><br>

Some of you seem to have trouble figuring things out on your own and keep asking questions that are already answered for you in documents that have been linked to you, so I'm gonna try to make things as clear as possible here.<br><br>


Pretty much everything you need to know is answered somewhere on <a href="commie.htm">this page</a> [that includes the links on the page, duh].
It's like your <a href="commie.htm"><b>Ultimate Guide to the Fansubbing Galaxy.</b></a>
<br><br>

But maybe you're overwhelmed with the amount of information presented to you. Sorry about that. I'm a bit old school - back in my days we used a lot less "LOL" and "TL;DR" and a lot more relevant information. The reason there's so much text is that you guys have shitload of questions, and instead of answering them 100 times to each of you I wrote all the answers down. If you're too lazy to read or have trouble reading then you have failed already.<br><br>

Now let me help you navigate through all that info.<br><br>

What you need to read and what you don't [yet]:<br><br>

Obviously TIMERS should read the <b>Timing section</b> and TYPESETTERS the <b>Typesetting section</b>.<br>
All of you should check the <b>Aegisub section</b>.<br>
If you need help with using IRC, you should check the <b>IRC guides</b>.<br>
That's the basics. The rest will come as needed.<br><br>

As for those of you just sitting in the channel doing nothing and then going "Uh, I don't know. Nobody told me anything." - you're wrong. Somebody surely told you to check <a href="commie.htm">this link</a> and that link tells you everything else. But I'm writing this for the slower ones so let me repeat myself...<br><br>

If you're a <b>timer</b>, read the WHOLE timing guide and take the basic timing test. Then upload the script somewhere [like privatepaste if you have no ideas], post the link to it in the bootcamp and highlight Orcus. He'll give you further instructions.<br><br>

If you're a <b>typesetter</b>, read the typesetting guide at least up to [and including] the Layers chapter and do the basic typesetting test. Then zip/rar the script and fonts you used and upload somewhere [mediafire, sendpace, whatever works], post the link to it in the bootcamp and highlight me - unanimated/reanimated. I'll give you further instructions but in the meantime read the whole typesettng guide, preferably several times.<br><br>

[If you don't know what <b>highlight</b> means, read the <b>IRC guides</b>.]<br><br>

When submitting your work, please add your name and what test it is to the filename. Otherwise I get shit like fonts.rar and typesetting.zip from everyone and have to keep renaming everything. Being organized is quite necessary when we work on 20 shows a week.<br><br>


If you have questions regarding timing/typesetting, they're with 99% probability answered in the guides so please R E A D &nbsp; T H E M. [btw, do you know what ctrl+F does?]<br><br>

If you have other questions, there's a 99% chance they can be answered by google so why not try that first before you ask us? We need people who can work on their own without us having to explain everything 100 times and checking everything after them.<br><br>

If neither the guides nor google give you the answer, it's time to ask the Ultimate Masters - us.<br><br>

Now, before you run away, never turning back, let me tell you this. No intern has ever quit/been fired because "they couldn't do it." Almost everyone quits on their own either because they're lazy or they get too busy with school and such. We only kick people when they sit in the channel idly for like 2 months, doing absolutely nothing and not responding to highlights ever.<br><br>

It may seem like a lot of stuff to learn at first, but it's not really that bad.<br><br>

Timing is in principle easy. It just takes a few episodes to learn to time faster.<br>
Typesetting requires learning a lot more stuff than timing, so it takes longer to get through the tests, but then most shows only have a few signs per episode. You certainly won't be required to typeset something like Acchi Kocchi as a beginner.<br><br>

As for the guides - I try to keep them updated but Aegisub keeps changing all the time, so some parts may be a bit obsolete.<br><br>
