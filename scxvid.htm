xvid keyframes are usually more accurate than x264 keyfarmes (which can be off by 1 frame near scene changes). However, they do behave slightly different so it may take a while for you to get used to it. Also, making xvid keyframes is only useful if you have no intention of making a workraw and you just want to time to the premux.

Things you need to install:<br><br>

1. <a target="_blank" href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/avisynth2/AviSynth%202.5/AviSynth%202.5.8/Avisynth_258.exe">Avisynth</a>
<br><br>
Install this first.
<br><br>

2. <a target="_blank" href="SCXvid.dll">SCXviD.dll</a> 
<br><br>
Place this is the Avisynth\Plugins folder wherever you just installed it.
<br><br>

3. <a target="_blank" href="https://code.google.com/p/ffmpegsource/downloads/list">ffms2.dll</a>
<br><br>
Copy this from you Aegisub folder and place it in the Avisynth\Plugins folder. The version included with the most recent build of Aegisub 3.0 should also have the most recent version of ffms2.dll.
<br><br>

4. <a target="_blank" href="http://akuvian.org/src/avisynth/avs2yuv/avs2yuv.exe">avs2yuv.exe</a> 
<br><br>
If you're lazy like me you can just place this in your C:\Windows folder. If you know what you're doing you can put it in whatever folder and add it to your path. You could also put it in whatever folder you're going to put the batch file from later in.
<br><br>

5. <a href="scx.zip">This batch script</a>  (below if you don't want to download it)
<br><br>


@echo off<br>
echo Making SCXvid keyframes...<br>
set video=%~1<br>
set video2=%~n1<br>
<br>
echo FFvideosource("%video%") > "%video2%_keyframes.avs"<br>
echo SCXvid("%video2%_keyframes.log") >> "%video2%_keyframes.avs"<br>
avs2yuv "%video2%_keyframes.avs" -o NUL<br>
del "%video2%_keyframes.avs"<br>
del "%video%.ffindex"<br>
echo Keyframes complete<br>
@pause<br><br><br>

Copy and paste this into a text file and rename it to keyframes.bat (or whatever.bat that you want). Personally, I place this on my desktop and drag the file I want to make keyframes for to the batch script. Although you can't see the progress, the script will tell you when it's done. It will also delete the files it created and leave you with just the keyframes. You can open these in Aegisub and time to the premux without spending time and hard drive space making a workraw.
